The Ilhui are desert-dwelling catfolk in the southern region of Amaura.  

### Yariy
The Ilhui have domesticated a form of scorpion called the Yariy. The Yariy are medium-sized scorpions (not big enough to ride) that are docile and fairly intelligent. The Yariy feed on smaller desert bugs, lizards, and more.
The Yariy are used as pets, and can be used as pack animals if they are big enough.
