# Achik

## Gameplay
Achik is a ranged character almost primarily, whose priestly talents enhance his normally mundane physicality. Using spells to enhance his jumps, range, moves, and more, Achik's kit relies on his *Attiniy* passive (translates to "capability" in Quechua). Without *Attiniy*, Achik relies on his priest's knife and other physical implements to supplement his missing magical power - not reliably, however. WITH plenty of *Attiniy*, he can make use of all of the fun abilites he wants, and be a powerful character to play.
