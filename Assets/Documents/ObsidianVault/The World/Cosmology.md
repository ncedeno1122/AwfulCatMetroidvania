## Cosmology (Gods & Magic)
One of the center points of this game is in how magic influences the world and interacts with the world in many ways.


### Deities
These deities are assisted in their various tasks by the spirits who are devout and serve them, who come in various encarnations under one consistent title. It's almost like a workplace where we refer to titles and THEN names as per the encarnation of the deity. Deities are succeeded when they wish to return to life, and select a soul to succeed them. 
Deities also contribute to various aspects of the planet and life on it. For example, there will be deities of:
- Earth/The Physical Realm (a la Pachamama)
- Water
- Fire
- Sun (Overworld Realms)
- Moon (Underworld Realms)
- Death
- Birth / Fertility
- Learning / Wisdom
- War / Blood
- Creativity / Art
- Mountains
- Volcanoes
- Rain (with goggles like Chaac?)

### Magic Power
Magic is a manifestation of a cosmic energy inherent to the universe. This power is cyclical in that every being is one of magic, whether they use it or know it or not. The energy is released when the creature dies. As well, the planets and stars create their own magic power, which is managed by a pantheon of deities.

Magic can be allocated and imbued when things are created, and released upon their destruction / death. When beings with souls imbue objects with their soul's magic, that helps nourish the continual stream of magic. Objects of worship that are offered to their respective deities (grain offerings to the deity of fertility) nourish them with the magic of their offerings. Through nourishment, the deities wax and wane with power.
	By this idea, cults that focus on certain deities and concepts (such as blood or sacrifice, malice, etc.) nourish and inflate the power of gods who may by their nature oppose other gods.
	This in turn allows for the creation of new gods as the people's values inform it. This will play into the overall plot.

>[!What Themes Do I Want to Promote?]
>There are potential democratic analogs that could be made here... I'm not trying to tell people how to live... But I again want to promote themes of charity, kindness, goodness to one another. Having FAITH in one another is important I think.

>It sounds all naive but we should just try to be good to one another.
