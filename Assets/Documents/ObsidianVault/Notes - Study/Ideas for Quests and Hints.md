Provided I was to make a dialogue system in which to learn more about the world via NPCs (could be off the back of a general interaction system for tiles and entities in my world), I could incentivize some of the exploration and backtracking that makes Metroidvanias cool and meaningful.

However, there are some different things about this... I believe that a lot of the fun of the Metroidvania genre is about exploring and doing things on your own volition. When you're constantly told what to do, it can get a little boring or disengaging. Like the Metroid: Zero Mission computer fella talking your ear off at certain checkpoints.

That *said*, this wouldn't be forced. If the player wants to talk or to accept quests, it would be their own choice to do so. Thus, this may be fun and engaging **depending on the challenge and reward of the quest**.

I'd have to think about rewards for completing quests, but that'd be for later.

My goal with this idea was to incentivize exploration and backtracking within the world/levels via either quests or dialogue-based hints. Maybe somebody says that they left something behind around this area in the mines, or the temple, or wherever. If you want it, you can totally go get it (normal adventuring risks considered).

Overall, I think as long as I don't *force* this aspect, this might be a good way to incentivize people to keep exploring areas and things like that.
