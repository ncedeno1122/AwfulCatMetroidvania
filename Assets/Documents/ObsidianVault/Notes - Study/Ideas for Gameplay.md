### Cat Statues
Perhaps for one of the FloorSwitches or InteractableTiles, I could sprite up a golden / silver cat sculpture *kinda* like the cat carving from Stardew with long limbs. These long limbs would hold a pressure plate, a lever/switch, or something to that effect.

### Quipu Puzzles
Seriously, what's cooler than quipu?
Wouldn't it be fun to make some sort of game or puzzle related to the quipu?
Or, some stone puzzle in a temple that was like a gridded wall of knots that you could press buttons to adjust, forming a code?
