Continuing from [[July 18th]].

Mannnn, I really want to start working on some initial abilities. And I worry that they're going to be busted, or feel weird, or SOMETHING, but I won't know until I: A) Make them B) Develop criteria to evaluate what makes something "busted" at all.

I also want to make music, work on something with the quipu minigame / mechanic / whatever, but I want to focus on abilities first. FIRST and foremost.

I wonder how MANY abilities I might go for... That's limited by buttons or input patterns though. I could do Smash-esque inputs.
