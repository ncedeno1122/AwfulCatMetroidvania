Oh boy, today's the day! Continuing from [[August 21st]], I got some good work done last night. I'm so EXCITED! I have so much cool stuff to make and test. I just have to think about how I want to implement it so far. There'll always be room for refactoring, as I'll soon learn as I detach basic attacks from Achik's current fire projectile scripts and all that.

---

First things first, I want to specify what it is I'm going to do today. Firstly, I want to get the Attiniy meter and UI up today. That'd be great.
	To do this, I need to think about how I want my resource. In the name of component-based fun times, why not make a component for it so I can decouple it from the PlayerController script?
	By the way, I KNEW I'd have to make some sort of AchikController. It's something only he needs. As such, I'd have a reference to it there.

In any case, I need some sort of component to actually store the Attiniy resource. Might it be a lot of scripts? Sure! But are they useful component scripts? Ohhh, you'd better BELIEVE it.

---

I've started with the AttiniyController script, and I want it to have a Slider. BUT, this violates the SRP to some degree in working with UI, so I'll make a seperate little script to reference for the actual Slider and UI.
Born is the  AttiniyUIController.

Aaaaand we're done, that was quick and fairly painless. What's better, I can actually try and decrease the cost of our Attiniy now by using abilities and all that. I'll have to see how I do this...

Well, I... I suppose I can do this... in MY COMPONENT SYSTEM THAT'S WELL ORGANIZED THAT'S RIGHT BABY!!! All I need to do is redirect myself to the soon-to-be-interfaced `ActivateSkill` function in each SkillComponent's script. Yes INDEEDY that's what I'm talking about.

Ahhh, now THAT's what I like to see. :)

In any case, I have to see about how to control whether or not we enter the skill's *STATE* depending on the cost of Attiniy that we'll have and all that.

To do that, I'm making an abstract `Skill` class with POTENTIALLY some child classes. I have to see. I need to have a child class of this called `ResourceSkill` that has a boolean function to check if the skill can be executed or not, and I think we should pass in some value to compare for us. What's more, ResourceSkill should provide an enumeration value for the type of resource it will use. THAT way I can dot my Is and cross my Ts in advance for Kowi's resources potentially.

ALRIGHTY well I've been trying to implement this abstraction I was just talking about, and thankfully with some cool problems. I tried to do them as abstract classes because I might want to share data, but it turns out that interfaces might work better I think. I can introduce a property for an interface to potentially point to... I think? Let's see...

Now I'm seeing that I need to make an AchikController that derives from PlayerController and 
 has hard references to the components that we need to have Achik do things. I can probably actually start to do away with the UnityEvents that I have been using. That's... almost comforting? In any case, that's what I need to do in order to make sure that we have sufficient Attiniy to activate skills and all that.
