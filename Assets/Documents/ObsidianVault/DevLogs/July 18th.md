LITERALLY cutting it so close before I teach my 6pm class, BUT I'm reading this Ecuadorian Quechua dictionary with translations in Spanish AND English and interpretation [[Citations & Resources#^d71fd9]] and I MIGHT go with the name "Acha", shortened from the work "Acharina" for faith for my now-named "Gilberto". The root of Ach- has a lot to do with different things that are key to a lot of other words. Perhaps we can reflect this in Acha's character.

"Yachay" is a good word for wisdom too. Funny enough, "yachayllankay" is the word for science, or "wisdom-work". Overall, I think names like either "Achik" or "Acha" might be nice. I think honestly I like "Achik".

I did a teeny bit more artwork today. I made a character called 
"Yachay", which ALSO translates to eduction and/or teaching too. If I was a character I'd like to be this one. That inspires me to pay close attention to the characters I make in the world and their lives (and how they might be impacted by the game's scenarios).
