Continuing from [[August 23rd]] and proudly so! I might go and grab a quick lunch before I HARD CARRY SOME MORE TODAY!!

I'm so excited! Because every time I get to design and then code, I am pleased with what I come up with to some degree. Today, I will be following up on and making my `AchikController` script with my concrete references. I will do away with my UnityEvent, cute little UI things because I now know what I want in terms of skills and all that. Ahh, how nice...

In any case, it'll serve almost exactly like my PlayerController except that it'll have references to work with for the Component scripts for Skills.
