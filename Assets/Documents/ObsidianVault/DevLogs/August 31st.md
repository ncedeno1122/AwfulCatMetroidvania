Continuing from [[August 28th]]. I had school this week, and tomorrow I'm going to meet with a club and go get some yummy eats from a food truck! I just can't forget to make coffee, I was yawning all during class today even if it was enjoyable.

I am thinking about lore today. I wanted to design more characters and things like that, but I decided that it might be best to ACTUALLY cement the lore of my world and things like that. I wanted to do a sort of top-level outline that will describe the INTENDED progression of my world, potentially. I worry that it might somehow stifle the nonlinearity of the map... Then again, perhaps not if I'm not very specific.

The first main thing would be solidifying areas and places with my game. I might start with the different peoples of the world / cultures and all that before. Or should I start with the land they inhabit, hrmmm...
