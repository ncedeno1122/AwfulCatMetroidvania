Continuing from [[August 4th]]! And oh boy, I'm so glad things are working out so far. Yesterday I was out with my family seeing Spongebob: The Musical and it was pretty good. It reminded me so much of how much I like presenting entertainment and things like that and making stuff. It also made me think so much about some fun tricks that theatres and stage plays like that use to achieve certain effects. Like lighting, music cues, expressions, and much more.

In any case, I wanted to take a small and very brief moment to be proud of my work LOL. It's taken a bit because my prototyping process is restricted by my ego and my desire to make good things and NOT bad things. I often get stuck debating the best approach, more efficient things and all that, when I don't have any approach at all. I shouldn't pre-optimize, and I can't refactor code that doesn't exist. So I'll have to make a commitment to myself to appreciate my work and try not to overthink things before they exist.

So last time I did some good work and I got done with the earliest, least polished form of the Spirit Form ability. I have to think about some of the other abilities that I want Achik to have, so that's something that I can do today. Or I could rewrite some of the physics and that stuff. Hmmm.

I kinda want to work on some more music and try and get into the mood of this game too. I've been more OK lately with embracing synth sounds, chromaticism (especially with panpipes), and working with more ATMOSPHERE with my compositional sketches for this project. It's fun, but I'm not quite sure.

I *do* want to think more about some abilities and things for Achik and possibly Kowi. I can't really do one without the other, and that's good for the design :). In any case, yeah, I need to develop some different passives and things like that.
	One thing that just crossed my mind is environmental damage like in Metroid. Like when you get hurt in hot rooms because the suit you have isn't upgraded to handle the heat or something. Maybe Achik can access areas with zones that require a deeper spiritual perception or something like that. Maybe he can open the WAY for Kowi to come in and do her thing or something. But she has to help him in turn, perhaps by breaking barriers he can't or doing something else that's cool. The main thing is keeping those capabilities balanced and equivalent while keeping them unique.

I'm interested in some different things. For example, priests would perform sacrifices involving knives a lot of the time. Specifically, the one with the little Tumi fellow. In any case, that could be something for Achik. I know I did want some sort of small AOE attack that was like a blessing thing (perhaps for Grounded Default Special) that would be uesd on objects in the world and enemies alike, that'd be cool. In any case, a knife would be cool. Maybe a stab downwards or something?
The physical stuff is MOSTLY reserved for Kowi, but that doesn't mean that she couldn't teach him something.

I was out for the most of today and had a very good time.
