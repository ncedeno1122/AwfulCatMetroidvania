Continuing from [[August 9th]].

I need to think more and more about these abilities and things like that. It's really important that I make a bunch of different, decoupled ideas for this Metroidvania for passive abilities and skills and things like that. Then, I can start plugging them in and all that stuff, but the first step is classifying the many that I think up. Perhaps this note will be a repository of possible ability ideas and thingsl ike that.

I was also watching a program tonight that investigated the presence of Yakumama around the Peruvian Amazon. What's more, Yakumama in Quechua means "Mother of Water" or something like that. Snakes in Inca mythology represent Ukhu Pacha, with the Puma representing Kay Pacha and the Condor for Hanan Pacha. It'd be interesting to see for sure if I  were to represent it in the game and all that.
Man, the animals of South America are just crazy. So varied, especially in the Amazon.

In any case, I think this list is both not final at all and very handy for me to pinpoint different things I want to put for my characters and all that. This definitely helps narrow down ALL the possibilities of the things I *could* do with eitehr character. However, it still *kinda* doesn't but hey, nothing's perfect.

I have a job interview tomorrow morning and I want to rest up for it so for NOW, I'm going to rest.
