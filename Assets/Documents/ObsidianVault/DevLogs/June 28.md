# First Note!
**Now** this project is official, lol. I usually always make an Obsidian vault for the projects that I post so I can always try to maintain my scoping and goals when I pick up a project again. Here, I aim to do so aggressively as this is the main project I aim to develop.

## Today's Work
Today I worked a lot in the morning and afternoon. I added the StoneBrickTile and ThatchedRoofTile assets, though the latter could probably use more work. What's more, I created a proper background tilemap that simulates parallax to some degree. As well, this note is being written from my laptop - I've uploaded the project to Github and added my yummy documentation with this Obsidian Vault. That's where we are now.
Tonight, before I rested, I changed up the control scheme a bit (D-Pad for movement input on Gamepads) and drew up some windows and doors.

## Next Work to do
I'm **dying** to get work on the interactable tiles I have planned for the game: triggers, the variety of Metroid-esque blocks that break upon being blasted, stood upon, and more things. I REALLY want to do this.

I will likely almost always be tuning my PlayerController script to fine-tune interactions, animations, and things like that to make the player character feel better.

I also want to get a song going for this town area that I'm working on right now.
