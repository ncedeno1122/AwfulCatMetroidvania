Continuing from [[September 1st]].
Man I tell you, I've been COOKING on some music. But not without reason, of course. My interest of late has been with the lore and world that the game takes place in. In the last note, I decided on a plot structure stemming from ideas in [[Cosmology]] and wrote them all down in the previous note. I may need to make a new note detailing this all in one place.

In any case, I worked today on some more fun music for a water-worshipping tribe of catfolk. They are the Yamu, like I had written initially in [[September 1st#The Yamu]]. But I *made* this tribe OFFICIALLY into the game (yet haven't documented it fully LOL) by selecting one or two deities that that population might disproportionately worship. That way, it's sort of like the areas in Majora's Mask. They suffer from some Majora-caused catastrophe and their lives are impacted by it and all that stuff. When the issue is resolved, everyone's happy and living and things are back to normal!

I was worried that this approach my be *too easy* and possibly even reductive to some extent? But that cookie-cutter formula isn't bad, because it creates a LIMITED number of gods and locations and correlates the two so there's a lot of direct payoff when you purify  the area.
	It'd be cool to make quests that depend on beating certain people. Like a character who can't grow a garden due to limited water, or that the soil isn't rich or something.
Overall, I don't think it's bad to go about the game this way. AND it allows for nonlinearity potentially! It'd just depend on the map design and all that. Which again is super cool.

Way I see it, I need to wrap up some of the work around the overarching story beats and all that stuff by making more concrete things in that realm. I'd LOVE to make a map or a list of societies that inhabit different realms. They don't have to be 1:1 per catfolk culture to real life culture, there can be unique communities as well.

In any case, I can make a list of different cultures / locations to eventually make with their communities. Otherwise though, I cannot forget where I'd left off on the development front. I need to round out some of Achik's abilities. The thing NOW is that I have more **context** to do so.
I want the Mi'cha culture in their capital to worship the deity of the Sun primarily, and the deity of Fertility / Growth. That manifests in Achik with his solar-based abilities, and his Blessing and all that from [[Achik#Skills]].

I implemented the Attiniy mechanic, but I did also want to make the basic attack toggle system somehow. That'd be AWESOME! I'd also need to make the other states for Achik's knife, which I still occasionally feel weird about BUT he's a priest and we can let his knife be his tool as a priest.

Here's a list of the things I wanna build here:
- Basic Attack Logic & Animations
- Achik's Knife Skills
- Achik Aiming Logic
- Solar Beam Ability?

I worked on more fun music today, and posted a few sketches of my tracks to Newgrounds again. I haven't been there for a while. But not sharing my work is a mistake, especially for my personal project this early in the game (both for the project and myself).

In any case, I might spend some of the night working on the game, or some more music. Ah, I've been having fun in charting out what I want for the game. Almost everything except ACTUALLY working on the game gives me more context. That context is what I need to keep on making certain decisions by implementing them in the game. It's a ton of fun so far, jeez...

I just want to do everything right now - art, music, code, writing, rrrgh. For now, I suppose I should continue cementing world information.
