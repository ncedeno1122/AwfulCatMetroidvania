I'm back and I wanted to brainstorm some more ideas from [[July 15th]]. I've just been BURSTING at the seems for this MEGA HINT that I seem to have gotten in having this idea about two main characters and all that. Think of the storytelling. Think of the abilities / gameplay. Think of the THEMING. It could be so cool...

Initially, and I always say this when thinking about the concept, I want the characters to FEEL different. This is very vague, however, because there's just about a million things I can do to make them actually different. I want them to have different abilities, but I could also **change the way they feel/play physics-wise**. I could **make one Melee and the other Ranged**. Aesthetically they're opposite because sun/moon and all that, but I can possibly do more than that.

I think it might be really cool to mess with physics-related stuff pertaining to both characters. Maybe one could be more agile than another or do special platforming stuff where another focuses more on combat or something.

There is absolutely a balance to be struck here. I have to give one another enough abilities but NOT TOO MUCH to allow them to handle different problems, I think. **I have to start thinking about those points where we recognize that one character is needed over another to progress.**

More than that too, I have to think about **HOW to switch our heroes out** at a time, and what that might look like too. Maybe in a room akin to Metroid save rooms? Then we leave the partner there until we both leave the dungeon? That might be more friendly with my level design considerations...

Let me upload this initial planning so I can do it on my laptop.

I'm getting more and more attached to the idea of a brawler-type character versus the more typical metroidvania Samus-like character. Melee-focused, powerful and/or movement focused mechanics might be fun.

I think one major consideration is what different breakable blocks I might want. Thinking of Super Metroid, there are breakable blocks for normal shots, the pink missiles, super missiles, the morph ball bombs, those bombs, and more. There's also breakable blocks for movement abilities, which is where I draw inspiration from.

Wouldn't it be fun to make a Wario-Land-esque dash? And melee combat with different tech or movement-based abilities?

Decoupling stories for different areas and quests would be very good. Like VERY good. That way I'm not just focusing on the overarching narrative, I'm working on area-specific stuff. This builds more on the world and brings more individuality to the areas.

Another thing I will have to focus on is travel time as it relates to pacing because I don't want to travel TOO long between areas when you're trying to get somewhere quickly. We'll have to see how we do this.

I'm so taken with the idea of a brawler character that controls differently now... But I don't want to give them a super big difference enough that it feels like a CHORE to swap...

I had this idea of a movement-only tile that allows you to jump extra on them FOR ONE CHARACTER or something. That might be fun. But character-specific breakable blocks is a must.

I just have to see how I might design my second character or something like that... That might inform their abilities. I have this idea about giving them a punch like Doomfist's or Vi's from League, where it's a dash (like WARIO's!). That might be cool for something as an attack too, that has value for being a non-projectile ability. 

It might be cool to make melee abilities around various weapons. A macahuitl maybe, a shield that could help with the rush/dash ability (OR a parry? :eyes:), a sling, an atlatl (or hul'che), darts, and more... Axes too, now that I think about it. This is a very Mayan-inspired list, I should say.
Ohhh, I almost forgot about the bola! LOL, how could I forget? That would be a fun cross-like thing like in castlevania. Something to add to that slashy, less-on-projectiles playstyle that that character might have.

Also for art ***I should be drawing POTS AND POTTERY and TEXTILES how could I forget...*** Those Moche vessels are cool.

Wouldn't it be cool to have a macahuitl mechanic where you lose certain obsidian blades per amount of time you swing? Or something pertaining to that?

The number of active blades on the macahuitl could be a general passive too, limiting certain abilities or something like that. That might be pretty cool, not gonna lie... Maybe it's something that you can grow the overall amount of (Ã  la super missile). Or it can be something like a resource meter.

I'm interested in the idea of somehow limiting resources if they're particularly strong or movement-based. AND representing that in a cool way if possible. The obsidian blades of a macahuitl would be neat for sure, but possibly not easy to read unless the center is also a slider too.
