I'm back and I wanted to brainstorm some more ideas from [[July 15th]]. I've just been BURSTING at the seems for this MEGA HINT that I seem to have gotten in having this idea about two main characters and all that. Think of the storytelling. Think of the abilities / gameplay. Think of the THEMING. It could be so cool...

Initially, and I always say this when thinking about the concept, I want the characters to FEEL different. This is very vague, however, because there's just about a million things I can do to make them actually different. I want them to have different abilities, but I could also **change the way they feel/play physics-wise**. I could **make one Melee and the other Ranged**. Aesthetically they're opposite because sun/moon and all that, but I can possibly do more than that.

I think it might be really cool to mess with physics-related stuff pertaining to both characters. Maybe one could be more agile than another or do special platforming stuff where another focuses more on combat or something.

There is absolutely a balance to be struck here. I have to give one another enough abilities but NOT TOO MUCH to allow them to handle different problems, I think. **I have to start thinking about those points where we recognize that one character is needed over another to progress.**

More than that too, I have to think about **HOW to switch our heroes out** at a time, and what that might look like too. Maybe in a room akin to Metroid save rooms? Then we leave the partner there until we both leave the dungeon? That might be more friendly with my level design considerations...

Let me upload this initial planning so I can do it on my laptop.
