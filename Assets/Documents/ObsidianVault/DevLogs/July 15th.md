Lalalala continuing from [[July 14th]], lalala...

So now I'm BIG chilling because I got some of the initial tile work and the foundations for my interactive environment system in order! It's not quite done nor refactored to my liking yet, but I'm in a spot where I can look to start doing other things.

So what should I do next, I suppose? Last night after my commit I was brainstorming on the whiteboard again, and I came up with some ideas where I could go next.

I was thinking about some different ideas about what I want to have in this project.

So before I start rambling, I was thinking of the narrative or story  and how I want that to play into things. That way, if I figure out my theming, I can actually make different things (and the actual game lolll).

I had an idea about talking to characters and being able to perform different quests. This might be neat or cool for a variety of different reasons, but I want to ensure that it fits comfortably within my game idea. 
	If you could talk to people, you could maybe talk with the spirits of those who have passed on or something like that. That's an easy little questline right there. But I have to think if that aligns with my formula and all that. Let's have a think.

Literally citing from the Wikipedia page on Metroidvanias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania),

>Igarashi described what he believed were key elements in the genre. These include designing maps that encourage exploration but which still guide the player on a main path through the game and providing means where the player can be aware of where they are in the game world at any time. This can be accomplished by graphical themes through the game's world, visually unique milestones at key game point, overall map and player status information screens, and the means of moving around the map quickly.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania#cite_note-gdc2014-10) Russ Frushtick from _[Polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website) "Polygon (website)")_ observed that many modern Metroidvanias not only have these qualities, but also find a means to tell a narrative through the world's environments without necessarily relying on cutscenes or dialog.
This article was very valuable to my research. With this, I can more confidently  say that level design is my priority, but with an interconnected world. This should be exciting to do... REALLY exciting...

It's important to note that limiting progression via power ups is a very important thing that I have to pay attention to.

Also, nobody said I *couldn't* have a dialog or cutscene thing go on for narrative purposes. If my game is narrative-focused, with main quests and other side quests available at different points then I need to evaluate how things should actually happen in my game.

I have to clarify too that I had this idea based on actual Andean dualism in their culture and religion. TLDR there's a world of the gods above and a world of death and rebirth below. It'd be cool to access these areas as parts of my game. It'd be cooler even to sever the connection at different points if it fits the narrative (if I have one that's particularly intensive).

What's more, I sat around and had this idea for the story, where the player character wants to be a shaman. But what if the player's father was the Sapa Inca/Emperor/***Son of the Sun***, and dies in the story of old age or sickness or something? That could be something caused by EVIL spirits, which we can vanquish for progress. These might be bosses as well.
The end of the game could be our player's succession to the throne as an adept shaman, good leader, good successor, and a good person in general (helping people via quests). Perhaps you could even be recognized as the next ***Son of the Sun***.

As you can read here, there's a lot of things I'm thinking at once (like always, but more relevant here). The main thing is that I've gotten down some of the super base stuff to make a good product. Kinda like making the flour from which you could make a dozen delicious pastries! How good that flour is is something I can improve, refactor, all that fun stuff, but I'm finally ready to start USING it!

It might be GDD time. I feel like I'm leaning towards that very very hard right now... I'll try it after I think more about what I want to do...

So I guess I can do some more of the brainwork here before I try and write up something official. What am I doing different? What is my Metroidvania's thing that other games might not have? What am I banking on?

After some reflection and a quick voice memo on my phone, I decided that I should be focused on making Abilities FIRST, since I will be trying to *design by limitation* in my own words. Essentially, I have to build my world off of the Abilties the player has, and limit them by what they don't have yet.
I had the idea of upgrading them using a resource you gain from fulfilling quests (maybe Achik (quechua for "having light"))?

That's actually kind of cool if you get this Achik / solar favor from the Sun God and become the Young Sun, destined to become the Son of the Son and recognized as such by the gods.

What if the narrative of the game is restoring balance and peace to the realms which is shaken up by the development of a few main demons (like bosses) with whom you purify/neutralize. Perhaps from other cultures, they coalesced into the world beneath and joined forces to cause chaos and make the world in their image.

What if you got to link up with, following Andean dualism tropes, if the main character is the "Young Sun" perhaps there is a "Young Moon" with whom you learn from and help purify the realms and restore balance? Hmm..... HMMMMM....... HMMMMMMMMMMMMM......

I really am liking that idea and frankly I'm scared... LOL... what if you were to explore the world as another character, the "Young Moon" and be able to access different areas and abilities and leave doors open for one another and all that stuff? WHAT IF???? Dude I'm so.... so worried that this is awesome...

I'm going to commit this work so far in the Github so I can think on this elsewhere...

I had a bit of a problem trying to use images and link to other addresses... I made a folder and another markdown file both titled "...md" and "..." which messed EVERYTHING up. So, I reverted the changes and I copied everything down so I could do it again. No problem, just a little copy and paste!

***OOOOKKK***, not doing that again lol. In any case, I'm glad that I'm back.
