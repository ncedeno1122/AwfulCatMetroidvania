I'm ***BACK*** (from [[July 19th]]) and I'm trying to work some more.  I'd been thinking so much about abilities and things like that, but I was still so weirdly worried about implementing them. Now, I think I just want to go for it and see what sticks. It's courage time, baby! Let's see what we've got.

---

First things first, my workflow will be a little different for the next week or so, I've been housesitting by myself with my dog, working around his schedule mostly. It's been fun and has offered me some great focus time, but some of my work time has been cut out by my need to make food and take care of Max. He's pretty awesome!

In any case though, I have to see how I would implement something like my abilities. Specifically, I wanted to make a system for my different characters and things like that. Preferably, I'd have a \_\_\_-controller for each character from which I can call other component-like scripts and all that stuff...  But I don't know...

My main thing right now is some movement abilities I'd like to implement. The problem is, they would VERY LIKELY conflict with the PlayerController script that I already have, you know? Like, I can't have two scripts moving my GameObject (obviously), but I'm unsurprisingly trying to find the best way I'm aware of forwards.

That way that I see is possibly by implementing a State pattern for my PlayerController depending on the movement abilities. Essentially, I'd have my PlayerController class which would be my context, holding my input and the current state we're in. The current physics-based state that I've made in PlayerController (which needed revisiting and rewriting ANYWAY) would be implemented in the State and all that stuff.

For Achik, I have this ability in mind, a Spirit Form, where you can transform into a floating orb of spirit energy and can fly for a certain few seconds or for a certain distance. Time might work better for that. **The main thing though** is that this will control differently than the normal player, we won't obey gravity and will generally control uniquely. This seems to shout to me for a state-focused approach.

There's more utility in states for me though. I want to make sure it's performant and actually good, and I worry... But I ALWAYS worry, so I should proceed if I'm just going to worry about it either way. Let's do some refactoring then, shall we?

---

Looking at my PlayerController class, it certainly DOES control the player LOL. It comes off to me as one of those early monoliths in the making. I ask myself now, is this necessary? Could I just decouple some of the functions from this class as a Component (as I did elsewhere with my Interactable and Breakable tile classes)?

To that I proudly say yes. It may cost more data-wise, potentially, but I think the approach is worth it. Isn't that what OOP is all about? (nyuck nyuck nyuck!)

Seriously though, I think this might be useful and scalable approach. If other things can use the components, that'd be really nice! Not to mention, it sets a decent precedent that I have STANDARDS (and that matters to me).

Let's start this little surgery like so:

---

So in my PlayerController class currently, I can tell how many different ideas I have in one script (violating the SRP ðŸ¤“) simply by looking at how many InputActions I have in the script.

I have my FireAction there which can easily be decoupled in a seperate script...

I have my InteractAction which *may* deserve its own script but I'm not so sure. For now, let's keep it (we can always decouple it later like we're doing now).

I have my MoveAction and JumpAction which are going to stay as well. I'm secretely excited because this might help simplify the Animation work depending on how I do my states...

Time to map out the states. I wonder if I can do one of those Mermaid diagrams here!

```mermaid
stateDiagram
	[*] --> Idle
	Idle --> Move: MovementInput.x != 0
	Move --> Idle: MovementInput.x == 0
	Move --> Jump: JumpAction Pressed
	Idle --> Jump: JumpAction Pressed
	Jump --> InAir: Immediately after adding Impulse
	Idle --> InAir: !IsGrounded && velocity.y < 0
	InAir --> Idle: IsGrounded
```

There is a good question remaining, however... Will I still have my main context-contoller class handle all of the actions and group them up in one place? Or, do I have my other classes get the actions and all that stuff.
It's nice to have things all in one place, but it's no good to violate the SRP... That's really my main concern at present, is that my context class, which I'd probably still call PlayerController, is full of stuff like this. Sigh.
Hmm... I could make them generic or specific, which is sort of the problem I was encounering before. If I made an AchikController and a KowiController, they'd have to hook up to different scripts, since they have different states and all that jazz... They'd be different but they'd share some of the same states like The basic structure I implemented above...

However, we would be listening for different spells at different times... Which is a bit of a hassle. I might need to write individual states to handle the different abilities I might add. For MOVEMENT abilities this work. I think for TECHNIQUE abilities (non-MOVEMENT) abilities this works too.

Again, I COULD try for some generic slots for abilities, the main thing is listening for the inputs for them. That might be something I do in my OnInputAction functions...

---

So far, things are well. I've just decoupled the FireAction things into a new script called FireProjectile script. It is sufficient for NOW, but I want to at some point *see how I could fire DIFFERENT projectiles.* That might be something for a different state though, I'm not sure...

In any case, there are no new problems I notice in doing this so far. The script could use refactoring (and can far more easily receive it now that it's decoupled), but it's good for now :D.

What next...
