Continuing from [[August 31st]].

I'm ACTUALLY working a bit on the lore in [[Cosmology]]. I was working on the system of deities and all that stuff lore-wise, but then I was thinking... I had this idea that people sort of create gods by what they believe in. There can be gods that are natural and of the world, but there are also people-created gods for the values the people believe in.

I was thinking about theming and all that, and now I have some neat ideas I think. I want to promote the themes of teamwork, cooperation, respect, and everything else, but I was also thinking...

I had this idea just moments ago about maybe Pandora's box-like things... Perhaps because the peoples of the world **create** their pantheons of belief, and the gods grow and shrink in power. If some malicious beliefs had taken a hold of the people like fear, that could spread and create other emotions within the world. Kinda like in God of War.

If those emotions take hold, they can be hard to shake and all that. But they are eventually beaten with things like love, trust, companionship, good will, etc. That reinforces my theme and all that.

Here's a question. Do the gods really care or concern themselves with the affairs of the cat people? Probably, because they need their devotion and faith to continue to exist. Like politicians and their approval ratings. 

Another question. Do gods interface / have impact on other gods? Sure, it only makes sense. The deity of water, the sun, and fertility are probably close because they ALL contribute to the growth of crops and whatnot.
Can they kill one another? Probably, based on the souls that follow them? It's like theological warfare I guess. Or simply because their 

What is the impact of the gods on the people? How does the god of water's worship-to-influence pipeline work? Well, if there is a lapse in devotion to the water god (from those non-fisherman, non-farmer city slickers), there may be drought or whatever. PERHAPS the deities of natural elements attempt to pull the strings of the planet and not have too much impact over one another (so it really gets funny and political there).
In that sense, certain gods influence one another like members of Congress and the House or like different members all working on one ongoing process / maintenance thing. Only it's global-scale.

Perhaps there are tangible effects in the world to what gods you purify fear from. OR WHATEVER this FEAR is going to be called. Long story short, if you purify fear from the sun, it may shine brighter.
If you purify fear from water, perhaps there are less monsters and more fish!
If you purify fear from the volcano deity, perhaps there are less eruptions or something that endanger EVERYONE. Perhaps a layer of volcanic smog from the air is removed, allowing the Sun's light to take hold.

Holy smokes, this is a REAL idea! I'm so freaked out by how well this might work out, I got some second opinions and it's being praised somewhat. Hrmm...

So one thing I'm encountering is that I am making these "if you purify fear from X this thing happens" and then I thinking of the impact of that on an individual area. Kinda like what happens in Majora's Mask after beating the boss. After you trash Goht in Snowhead the blizzard stops and spring comes, everyone's happy, but Majora-related problems still remain elsewhere in the world. That's how I should think of it, like a water droplet. For places that RELY on certain resources, they might worship deities in a certain priority over other places, and their deterioration and restoration from fear might affect THEIR community disproportionately compared to others.
	I was thinking, some cool dialogue might be like "The water goddess has regained her strength! The fish have returned to us! Huzzah!" from someone in some heavily-water-dependent tribe, but another place might be like "We received word that the importing of shrimp is available again. Finally I can make my casserole again...".
	**I want (NEED) to show that these purifications have impact**.

In doing this all, I think Achik and Kowi will represent the hope of the people, Pandora's box style. Hope will beat out fear, hope in them. But interestingly, there is no deity for hope because EVENTUALLY, both Achik and Kowi will be the new deities of hope after the old one was destroyed by fear????? That might be coooooooool......... That might be REALLY cool!

---

And maybe with all of this stuff, we can make and theme abilities based on Achik and Kowi's cultures beliefs and things like that. For Achik, his Spirit Form is like turning into a little sun, his bless and prayer are like sunshine, and more things...
Maybe Kowi's culture of warriors in the jungle primarily worships the god of War, and the god of the Moon. And that manifests in Kowi's kit by being a warrior and having all those tools, but also by being The Daughter of The Moon and perhaps some moon themed abilities.

RRAAArrrgghhhh, this is getting good. Because with this one-to-two deity rule, I can assign them to certain cultures and what not that you might visit during your time.

The question is, what purpose will visiting those peoples from different villages have besides just being dialogue that reflects the game state and seeing the before and after? Perhaps they give skills and things like that? There must be more to the picture too. Perhaps you can complete quests relating to the different realms with them as well.

(I just feel so crazy because I hear the music for this. This stuff has stakes, this plot. People's lives, the world is at risk of being destroyed by this, the work we're doing matters. It's almost somewhat epic.)

#### The Yamu
I wanted to make a culture potentially inspired by the traditions of the Taino as well, island-living, kind, matriarchal folks. They might worship the Water god primarily and god of Volcanoes maybe? 
I ended up making a little tropical-sounding groove in Cubase and looking up the Taino word for cat. It ended up being called Yamuy, so I might make the island tribe the Yamu people. The groove is neat but it made me think about the Thanos twerking gif and I can't stop laughing about it lol.

In any case, this ROCKS! I feel like this is a good way to connect the impacts of this purification to different parts of the world, with different peoples for worldbuilding, new tunes for music, and more content for the actual game! Talk about a favorable stone-to-bird ratio here!

In any case, I should commit this and go to bed for now, but I definitely have to pick this up tomorrow.
